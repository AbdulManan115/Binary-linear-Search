# *Binary Search vs Linear Search: Implementation and Insights*

---

## *Introduction*

This project implements two fundamental search algorithms: *Binary Search* and *Linear Search*. Both algorithms are essential for understanding search techniques in programming:  
- *Binary Search* demonstrates efficiency in sorted data.  
- *Linear Search* showcases versatility for all types of data.

---

## *Purpose of the Code*

- *Linear Search*: Scans each element in the list sequentially until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.  
- *Binary Search*: Designed for sorted data, it efficiently divides the list into halves, narrowing down the search area until the target is located or confirmed to be absent.

---

## *Time Complexity Comparison*

### *Linear Search*
- *Best Case*: O(1) â€“ When the target is the first element in the list.  
- *Worst Case*: O(n) â€“ When the target is at the end of the list or not present.

### *Binary Search*
- *Best Case*: O(1) â€“ When the target is at the middle of the list.  
- *Worst Case*: O(log n) â€“ As the algorithm repeatedly divides the sorted list.

> *Note: Binary Search is not applicable to unsorted lists. Attempting it would result in **incorrect results*, not just inefficiency.

## *Steps to Run the Program*

1. *Clone the Repository*: Clone the project to your local machine using Git.  
markdown
Copy code

2. *Open the Directory*: Navigate to the project folder in your preferred code editor.  

3. *Run the Code*: Execute the program in Python.  
python search_algorithms.py


4. *Input Data*: Provide a list of numbers and a target value.  

5. *View Results*:  
- The program will perform *Linear Search* and *Binary Search* (for sorted lists).  
- It will display the index of the target if found or a message if itâ€™s not in the list
> *Tip: You can also use online platforms like **Programiz Python Compiler* to run the code effortlessly.

## *Key Takeaways*

- *Binary Search*: Ideal for sorted data, significantly faster for large datasets.  
- *Linear Search*: Simple and versatile, works for both sorted and unsorted data.  
- *Understanding*: Knowing the strengths and limitations of each algorithm ensures you choose the right one for your use case.
